Python Interface to Array 3710A DC Electronic Load

See bottom of script for initial testing and as an example of how to use the package.

One thing I have noticed, while testing program mode, is timing accuracy
of my first TekPower 3710A load.  I'm seeing 10 second steps take just
under 7 seconds to complete.  I won't be using program mode much, but this
was surprising to me.
